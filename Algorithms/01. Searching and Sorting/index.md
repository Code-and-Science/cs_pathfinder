# Searching and Sorting

## Introduction

Searching for specific items in a large amount of data is probably one of the most used functionality in programming. A huge part of our work as programmers is related to organizing data and making sure that relevant data can be easily accessed when needed and processed efficiently.
Sorting data (or keeping it sorted) is the fundamental functionality that allows any database to work even with large datasets. A good understanding of searching and sorting enables us to
take a first look on general principles of problem solving like
"divide and conquer" and efficiency of algorithms.

## Concepts

- Binary Search
- Sorting algorithms
  - Bubblesort
  - Quicksort
  - Mergesort
  - Properties of sorting algorithms

## Learning material

## Exercises

- Implement Binary search (Solution recursion), (Solution iteration)
- Implement functions that sort a list using bubblesort, quicksort
  and mergesort.
- How long does it take to sort a list of random numbers with each algorithm?
  - with 10 numbers
  - with 1000 numbers
  - with 100000 numbers
  - with 10000000 numbers?
